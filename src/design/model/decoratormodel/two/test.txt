i am a test Skips over and discards n bytes of data from the input stream.
The skip method may, for a variety of reasons, end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes,
possibly 0. If n is negative, the method will try to skip backwards. In case the backing file does
 not support backward skip at its current position, an IOException is thrown. The actual number of
 bytes skipped is returned. If it skips forwards, it returns a positive value. If it skips backwards,
 it returns a negative value.
 This method may skip more bytes than what are remaining in the backing file. This produces no exception and
  the number of bytes skipped may include some number of bytes that were beyond the EOF of the backing file.
   Attempting to read from the stream after skipping past the end will result in -1 indicating the end of the file.
